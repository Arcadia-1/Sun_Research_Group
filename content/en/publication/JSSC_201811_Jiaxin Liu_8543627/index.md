abstract: "This paper presents a compact and power efficient third-order continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma (ΔΣ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a single operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). A 4-bit second-order fully passive noise-shaping (NS) successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADC is employed as the quantizer while inherently provides two additional NS orders. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, the prototype occupies 0.029 mm 2 of active area and consumes 1.16 mW of power when clocked at 500-MHz sampling frequency. The proposed CT ΔΣ ADC achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 70.4 dB over 12.5-MHz bandwidth, yielding a Walden figure of merit (FoM) of 17 fJ/conversion-step."
