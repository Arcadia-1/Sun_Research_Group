summary: ISSCC, 2008

abstract: "This paper reports the smallest complete nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system made possible by CMOS integration of a highly sensitive and versatile RF transceiver. The system's functionality is verified through proton NMR measurements in water and biomolecular sensing. The system is 60x more sensitive, 40x smaller, and 60x lighter than a commonly-used, state-of-the- art commercial benchtop NMR system."
