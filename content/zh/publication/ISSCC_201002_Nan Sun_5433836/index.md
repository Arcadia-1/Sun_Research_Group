summary: ISSCC, 2010

abstract: "A 0.1 kg palm NMR system using a fully integrated CMOS RF transceiver is reported. It is 20× lighter, 30× smaller, yet 2.5× more spin-mass sensitive than our prior system, and 1200× lighter, 1200× smaller, yet 150× more spin-mass sensitive than a commercial system. A one-chip NMR system for on-chip disease screening is also reported, which detects hCG cancer markers and bladder cancer cells."
